I adjusted the number of checkers to see the affect on the wait time and idle time. Going any number above 5 will 
not make the wait time go down at all but will increase the idle time each time the value is increased. I found that 
having 4 checkers checkers is the most effecient because the wait time is around the same and the idle time goes down
drastically.
